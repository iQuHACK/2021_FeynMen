## Introduction

## Motivation/goals

Having a README in your team's repository facilitates judging. A good README contains:
* a clear title for your project,
* a short abstract,
* the motivation/goals for your project,
* a description of the work you did, and
* proposals for future work.

You can find a potential README template in [one of last year's projects](https://github.com/iQuHACK/QuhacMan).

Feel free to contact the staff with questions over our [event's slack](https://iquhack.slack.com), or via iquhack@mit.edu.

Good luck!
